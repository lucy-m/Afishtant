This was a project to build a fishing bot in New World. It works by scanning an area of the screen looking for certain colours which appear when a fish has been hooked. It worked mostly.

I don't play New World any more but please don't tell Amazon or they might tell me off. Hopefully they've updated fishing since then and this bot won't work any more.
